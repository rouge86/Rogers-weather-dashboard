# Rogers-weather-dashboard challenge
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. The challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

I used openweatherAPI & moment js to complete this. I attempted to use giphy but could not display pictures in the desired divs. I will keep trying to fix this, for now it has been commented out.

## Description
- The motivation is to develop a weather app using 3rd Party Web API skills like jQuery, Bootsrap, moment.js.
- This app is my optimised version of https://github.com/markdcross weather dashboard. I have tried to enhance it by having the background chage colours based moment.js timing
- Through this challenge I have built confidence in manipulating css using bootsrap framework & am gaining a better understanding of how to fetch data from server APIS

## Acceptance

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe✔️
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity ✔️
